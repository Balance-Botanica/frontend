### Task 008: Add Newsletter Subscription and Marketing Features
**Status:** INVESTIGATION COMPLETE
- **Current State**: EmailSubscription.svelte component already exists but has placeholder logic
- **Findings**:
  - Component is already built with proper UI and translations
  - Uses footer.newsletter translations from i18n files
  - Has compact mode support
  - Includes proper form validation and submission handling
  - Currently has placeholder logic (simulates API call with setTimeout)
- **Recommendations**:
  1. **Easiest Option**: Integrate with a service like Mailchimp, SendGrid, or Buttondown
     - Pros: No server infrastructure needed, reliable delivery, analytics
     - Cons: Monthly cost, third-party dependency
  2. **Self-hosted Option**: Store emails in database and send manually
     - Pros: Full control, no recurring costs
     - Cons: Need to build email sending infrastructure, spam management
  3. **Hybrid Option**: Store emails locally and use a simple email service
     - Pros: Balance of control and reliability
     - Cons: More complex implementation
- **Recommendation**: Use Buttondown.email or Mailchimp for easiest implementation
  - Both have free tiers that would work for initial needs
  - Simple API integration
  - Professional email delivery
  - Analytics and management dashboard
- **Implementation Plan**:
  1. Choose email service provider (recommendation: Buttondown.email)

- Application now loads correctly after fixing the JSON syntax

### Telegram Bot Order Display Issue
**Status:** COMPLETED
- Fixed Telegram bot not displaying orders when admin commands `/orders` or status filters were used
- The issue was in `sendOrdersByStatus` method calling `orderService.getOrdersByUserId('all')` instead of `getAllOrdersForAdmin()`

- Verified that orders exist in database (2 orders found)
- Bot now correctly retrieves and displays all orders for admin

  - Single "Доставлено" button for delivery
- **Interactive Order ID Input**: Implemented order ID input system where:
  - User clicks action button (e.g., "Підтвердити заказ")
  - Bot prompts for order ID input
  - User types order ID (can copy from order display)
  - Bot processes the action on specified order
- **TTN Integration for Shipping**: Enhanced shipping process with TTN (tracking number) validation:
  - When "Відправити заказ" is selected, bot prompts for Nova Poshta TTN
  - TTN validation (must be 14 digits)
  - Status only updates to "shipped" after valid TTN is provided
  - Confirmation message includes TTN number
  - Proper error handling for invalid TTN format
