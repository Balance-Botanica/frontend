**Status:** DEFINED
- Not a comparison between our products, but between our products and Western competitors
- Compare price and ingredients
- Will use provided data and pictures of competitor products
- Design product comparison interface

### Task 007: Implement Order Management and Checkout Process
**Status:** HIGH PRIORITY

- Implement checkout flow with multiple steps
- Add payment processing integration
- Design order confirmation and tracking system
- Implement order history and management
- **Specific requirement**: Integration with Nova Poshta (Ukraine delivery service)
- Will use provided Nova Poshta API snippets

### Task 008: Add Newsletter Subscription and Marketing Features
**Status:** INVESTIGATION COMPLETE
- **Current State**: EmailSubscription.svelte component already exists but has placeholder logic
- **Findings**:
  - Component is already built with proper UI and translations
  - Uses footer.newsletter translations from i18n files
  - Has compact mode support
  - Includes proper form validation and submission handling
  - Currently has placeholder logic (simulates API call with setTimeout)
- **Recommendations**:
  1. **Easiest Option**: Integrate with a service like Mailchimp, SendGrid, or Buttondown
     - Pros: No server infrastructure needed, reliable delivery, analytics
     - Cons: Monthly cost, third-party dependency
  2. **Self-hosted Option**: Store emails in database and send manually
     - Pros: Full control, no recurring costs
     - Cons: Need to build email sending infrastructure, spam management
  3. **Hybrid Option**: Store emails locally and use a simple email service
     - Pros: Balance of control and reliability
     - Cons: More complex implementation
- **Recommendation**: Use Buttondown.email or Mailchimp for easiest implementation
  - Both have free tiers that would work for initial needs
  - Simple API integration
  - Professional email delivery
  - Analytics and management dashboard
- **Implementation Plan**:
  1. Choose email service provider (recommendation: Buttondown.email)
  2. Create account and get API key
  3. Add API key to environment variables
  4. Replace placeholder logic in EmailSubscription.svelte with actual API call
  5. Add error handling and user feedback
  6. Test integration

### Task 009: Implement Admin Dashboard for Product Management
**Status:** LOW PRIORITY
- Create admin authentication and authorization
- Design product management interface
- Implement CRUD operations for products
- Add inventory management features
- Create sales and analytics dashboard

### Task 010: Add Multi-language Support and Localization Improvements
**Status:** COMPLETE
- Enhanced existing i18n implementation
- Translation files are up to date
- Language switcher component working
- **Fixed orders page localization**: Replaced hardcoded translations with proper i18n system
- **Fixed goto import issue**: Added proper import for navigation in orders page

## Bug Fixes and Maintenance

### JSON Syntax Error Fix
**Status:** COMPLETED
- Fixed JSON syntax error in `en.json` file (extra comma after "cancelledError" field)
- This was causing the SvelteKit application to fail loading with "Failed to parse JSON file" error
- Application now loads correctly after fixing the JSON syntax

### Telegram Bot Order Display Issue
**Status:** COMPLETED
- Fixed Telegram bot not displaying orders when admin commands `/orders` or status filters were used
- The issue was in `sendOrdersByStatus` method calling `orderService.getOrdersByUserId('all')` instead of `getAllOrdersForAdmin()`
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the order retrieval chain (TelegramBot → OrderService → DrizzleOrderRepository)
- Verified that orders exist in database (2 orders found)
- Bot now correctly retrieves and displays all orders for admin

### Telegram Bot UI Enhancement
**Status:** COMPLETED
- **Detailed Order Information**: Replaced brief order summaries with comprehensive order details including:
  - Order ID, date, total amount
  - Complete product list with quantities and prices
  - Delivery address information
  - Customer notes
  - Visual separators for better readability
- **Streamlined Interface**: Replaced individual action buttons per order with unified control buttons:
  - Single "Підтвердити заказ" button for confirmation
  - Single "Скасувати заказ" button for cancellation
  - Single "Відправити заказ" button for shipping
  - Single "Доставлено" button for delivery
- **Interactive Order ID Input**: Implemented order ID input system where:
  - User clicks action button (e.g., "Підтвердити заказ")
  - Bot prompts for order ID input
  - User types order ID (can copy from order display)
  - Bot processes the action on specified order
- **TTN Integration for Shipping**: Enhanced shipping process with TTN (tracking number) validation:
  - When "Відправити заказ" is selected, bot prompts for Nova Poshta TTN
  - TTN validation (must be 14 digits)
  - Status only updates to "shipped" after valid TTN is provided
  - Confirmation message includes TTN number
  - Proper error handling for invalid TTN format
- **Operation Cancellation**: Added comprehensive cancellation system:
  - Cancel button in input prompts
  - /cancel command for quick operation cancellation
  - State cleanup on cancellation
  - Return to order list after cancellation
- **State Management**: Added user state tracking to handle multi-step interactions
- **Enhanced User Experience**: All orders now displayed in full detail with cleaner, more intuitive interface
- **Order Status Display**: Added clear status indication for each order in Telegram bot with emoji and text

### TypeScript Error Fix in ProductCard Component
**Status:** COMPLETED
- Fixed TypeScript error where `HTMLDivElement` was being assigned to `imgRef` which should be `HTMLImageElement`
- Moved `bind:this={imgRef}` from the div wrapper to the actual img elements
- This resolves the type mismatch error and ensures proper image loading detection functionality

## New Features Implementation

### User Profile Page with Delivery Address Management
**Status:** COMPLETED
- Created `/profile` route accessible from the header user icon

- Added delivery address form with fields for street, city, postal code, and country

- Implemented Drizzle repository for user and delivery address operations
- Created user service for business logic

- Integrated with existing authentication system
- Fully translated in both English and Ukrainian

## Development Guidelines

3. Maintain consistency with the design system and styling
4. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback
5. Write clean, maintainable code with appropriate comments
