### Task 004: Add Product Reviews and Rating System
**Status:** HIGH PRIORITY
- Design review submission form
- Implement star rating system
- Create review display component
- Add review moderation features
- Implement review analytics

### Task 005: Implement Wishlist Feature
**Status:** NOT NEEDED
- Feature not required at this time

### Task 006: Add Advanced Product Comparison Tool
**Status:** DEFINED
- Not a comparison between our products, but between our products and Western competitors
- Compare price and ingredients
- Will use provided data and pictures of competitor products
- Design product comparison interface
- Implement side-by-side product feature comparison

### Task 007: Implement Order Management and Checkout Process
**Status:** HIGH PRIORITY
- Create shopping cart functionality
- Implement checkout flow with multiple steps
- Add payment processing integration
- Design order confirmation and tracking system
- Implement order history and management
- **Specific requirement**: Integration with Nova Poshta (Ukraine delivery service)
- Will use provided Nova Poshta API snippets

### Task 008: Add Newsletter Subscription and Marketing Features
**Status:** INVESTIGATION COMPLETE
- **Current State**: EmailSubscription.svelte component already exists but has placeholder logic
- **Findings**:
  - Component is already built with proper UI and translations
  - Uses footer.newsletter translations from i18n files
  - Has compact mode support
  - Includes proper form validation and submission handling
  - Currently has placeholder logic (simulates API call with setTimeout)
- **Recommendations**:
  1. **Easiest Option**: Integrate with a service like Mailchimp, SendGrid, or Buttondown
     - Pros: No server infrastructure needed, reliable delivery, analytics
     - Cons: Monthly cost, third-party dependency
  2. **Self-hosted Option**: Store emails in database and send manually
     - Pros: Full control, no recurring costs
     - Cons: Need to build email sending infrastructure, spam management
  3. **Hybrid Option**: Store emails locally and use a simple email service
     - Pros: Balance of control and reliability
     - Cons: More complex implementation
- **Recommendation**: Use Buttondown.email or Mailchimp for easiest implementation
  - Both have free tiers that would work for initial needs
  - Simple API integration
  - Professional email delivery
  - Analytics and management dashboard
- **Implementation Plan**:
  1. Choose email service provider (recommendation: Buttondown.email)
  2. Create account and get API key
  3. Add API key to environment variables
  4. Replace placeholder logic in EmailSubscription.svelte with actual API call
  5. Add error handling and user feedback
  6. Test integration

### Task 009: Implement Admin Dashboard for Product Management
**Status:** LOW PRIORITY
- Create admin authentication and authorization
- Design product management interface
- Implement CRUD operations for products
- Add inventory management features
- Create sales and analytics dashboard

### Task 010: Add Multi-language Support and Localization Improvements
**Status:** COMPLETE
- Enhanced existing i18n implementation
- Translation files are up to date
- Language switcher component working

## Development Guidelines

1. Always check the existing codebase structure before implementing new features
2. Follow the established component patterns and architecture
3. Maintain consistency with the design system and styling
4. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback
5. Write clean, maintainable code with appropriate comments
6. Test all functionality across different devices and browsers
7. Update documentation when implementing new features

## Notes for Future Development Sessions

- The development server is already running on port 5173
- No need to restart or run additional server instances
- This PLANNING file should be referenced at the beginning of each development session
- Progress should be updated in this file as tasks are completed
- New tasks or modifications to existing tasks should be documented here
