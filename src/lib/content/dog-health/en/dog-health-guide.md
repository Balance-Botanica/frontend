# Dog Health: Natural Wellness Guide 2024

Dogs are not just pets - they are our loyal friends and companions. A dog's health depends on many factors: proper nutrition, regular exercise, emotional state, and disease prevention.

Imagine this: your dog is active, with shiny fur, bright eyes, and a tail that wags constantly. This is not just a dream - it's the result of attentive and comprehensive care. Let's explore how to achieve this with natural methods.

## Anatomical Features of Dogs

### Digestive System
Dogs are omnivores, but their digestive tract is adapted to consume meat as the main source of nutrition.

**Key features:**
- Shorter digestive tract compared to herbivores
- Need more proteins and fats
- Important role of pancreatic enzymes
- Sensitivity to rapid diet changes

### Age and Physiological Changes
A dog's health changes with age, and this is important to consider in care.

**Age periods:**
- **Puppies (up to 1 year):** Rapid growth, bone system formation
- **Young dogs (1-3 years):** Peak activity and energy
- **Adult dogs (3-7 years):** Stable period
- **Senior dogs (after 7 years):** Decreased metabolism, joint problems

## Proper Dog Nutrition

### Basic Principles
Nutrition is the foundation of your dog's health. A properly balanced diet provides all the necessary nutrients.

**Main components:**
- **Proteins:** 18-25% of diet (meat, fish, eggs)
- **Fats:** 10-15% (fish oil, vegetable oils)
- **Carbohydrates:** 30-50% (grains, vegetables)
- **Fiber:** For normal digestion

### Natural Supplements for Dogs

#### Glucosamine and Chondroitin
For joint and cartilage health support.

**Especially beneficial for:**
- Large breed dogs
- Sporting dogs
- Senior dogs

#### Omega-3 Fatty Acids
For skin, fur, and reduced inflammation.

**Benefits:**
- Reduced skin itching
- Improved coat quality
- Joint support
- Anti-inflammatory action

#### Probiotics
For healthy digestion and immune system.

**When needed:**
- After antibiotics
- When changing diet
- To prevent diarrhea

#### CBD (Cannabidiol)
For comprehensive health support and pain relief.

**Proven effectiveness:**
Scientific studies show that CBD can help dogs with various health issues:

- **Joint pain:** A 2023 randomized study demonstrated that CBD at 2 mg/kg twice daily significantly reduced pain and increased activity in dogs with osteoarthritis compared to placebo ([Gamble et al., 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36758519/))

- **Seizures:** A 2023 study showed CBD's potential as an adjunct therapy for reducing seizure frequency in dogs with treatment-resistant epilepsy ([McGrath et al., 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36719002/))

- **Safety:** Comprehensive pharmacokinetic study helped understand how dogs' bodies absorb and metabolize different forms and doses of CBD ([Deabold et al., 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36719199/))

## Most Common Dog Health Problems

### Joint Problems
