		"questions": {
			"what_is_cbd": {
				"question": "What is CBD?",
				"answer": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is a natural compound found in the hemp plant. It does not cause euphoria or a 'high', but has therapeutic properties including anti-inflammatory, antiepileptic, anxiolytic, and neuroprotective effects."
			},
			"how_does_cbd_work": {
				"question": "How does CBD work in the body?",
				"answer": "CBD interacts with the body's endocannabinoid system (ECS), which regulates many physiological processes including mood, pain, inflammation, and sleep. CBD helps maintain balance in this system."
			},
			"is_cbd_safe_for_pets": {
				"question": "Is CBD safe for pets?",
				"answer": "Yes, CBD is generally considered safe for pets, especially when derived from hemp and containing no THC. However, always consult with your veterinarian before starting use."
			},
			"will_cbd_get_my_pet_high": {
				"question": "Will CBD get my pet high?",
				"answer": "No, our products contain only CBD and do not contain THC - the psychoactive compound that causes euphoria. CBD does not cause changes in consciousness or behavior."
			},
			"how_to_dose_cbd": {
				"question": "How to properly dose CBD?",
				"answer": "Dosage depends on the pet's weight, condition, and sensitivity. We recommend starting with a lower dose and gradually increasing. Use our dosage calculator or consult with your veterinarian."
			},
			"cbd_side_effects": {
				"question": "Are there any side effects of CBD?",
				"answer": "CBD is generally well-tolerated, but some pets may experience drowsiness, changes in appetite, or mild digestive upset. These effects are usually temporary and resolve with dose adjustment."
			}
		},
		"benefits": {
			"question": "What are the benefits of CBD for pets?",
			"answer": "CBD can help with anxiety, pain relief, inflammation reduction, improved sleep, and overall wellness for pets. It's particularly beneficial for dogs and cats with arthritis, anxiety, or digestive issues."
		},
		"choosing": {
			"question": "How do I choose the right CBD product for my pet?",
			"answer": "Consider your pet's size, condition, and preferences. Start with a lower concentration and gradually increase. Consult our dosage calculator or your veterinarian for personalized recommendations."
		},
		"testing": {
			"question": "How do I know if the CBD is working for my pet?",
			"answer": "Monitor your pet's behavior, energy levels, and any symptoms they're experiencing. Keep a journal of their progress. Effects are usually noticeable within 30-60 minutes, but full benefits may take 1-2 weeks of consistent use."
		},
		"spectrum": {
			"question": "What's the difference between full-spectrum, broad-spectrum, and CBD isolate?",
			"answer": "Full-spectrum contains all cannabinoids including trace THC, broad-spectrum has most cannabinoids but no THC, and isolate is pure CBD. Full-spectrum may provide enhanced benefits through the entourage effect."
		},
		"effects": {
			"question": "What are the potential side effects of CBD for pets?",
			"answer": "CBD is generally well-tolerated, but possible side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, or mild digestive upset. These are usually temporary and resolve with dose adjustment. Always start with low doses."
